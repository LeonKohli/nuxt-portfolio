# ChatGPT HTML Web View

As a developer who frequently uses ChatGPT to generate HTML code snippets, I found myself constantly copying and pasting code into separate files or online editors just to see how it would render. This workflow interruption was frustrating, so I built a simple solution.

## How It Works

This lightweight browser extension adds a "Preview" button directly in the ChatGPT interface whenever HTML code is detected. With one click, you can:

1. See the rendered HTML in a popup window
2. Test JavaScript functionality
3. View CSS styling as intended
4. Make quick edits and see changes in real-time

The extension automatically updates the preview as you modify the code in ChatGPT, eliminating the need to constantly refresh or re-copy code.

## Key Features

- **Live Code Previews**: Instantly see how your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code renders
- **CodePen Integration**: Easily share your creations with others through a direct export option
- **Customizable Appearance**: Adjust the preview window size, position, and styling to your preferences
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within the ChatGPT interface without disrupting your workflow
- **Automatic Updates**: Preview refreshes automatically when code changes are detected

## Development Process

I built this extension using vanilla JavaScript to keep it lightweight and avoid unnecessary dependencies. The main challenge was properly parsing and sanitizing the HTML from ChatGPT's responses while preserving functionality. The extension uses DOM manipulation to:

1. Detect code blocks in the ChatGPT interface
2. Parse and validate the HTML content
3. Render the preview in a secure iframe
4. Handle real-time updates as the conversation progresses

## Installation

The extension is available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers:

- **Chrome**: Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-web-preview/didmdeafjnnkgjkfalkkdhmgoajjnpom)
- **Firefox**: Available in the Firefox Add-ons repository

After installation, simply navigate to ChatGPT and start generating HTML code. The preview button will appear automatically when code is detected.

## User Impact

The extension has been downloaded by hundreds of developers who appreciate the streamlined workflow it provides when prototyping with AI assistance. It's particularly valuable for:

- Web developers testing UI components
- Educators demonstrating code concepts
- Students learning web development
- Designers quickly visualizing layout ideas
