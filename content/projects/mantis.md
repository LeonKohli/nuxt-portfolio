# Gottesanbeterin gesucht

This citizen science project tracks the northward expansion of the European Mantis (Mantis religiosa) across Brandenburg, Germany. Climate change has allowed these fascinating insects to expand their habitat, and we're documenting this ecological shift in real-time through a collaborative effort with the Naturkundemuseum Potsdam.

## The Project's Impact

Since launching in March 2023, we've collected over 14,000 individual sightings from citizen scientists. Each report includes location data, photos, and observation details that help researchers understand the mantis population's movement patterns. The project has been featured in regional media and has become a valuable resource for entomologists studying insect adaptation to climate change.

## Technical Implementation

The platform uses a Flask backend with PostgreSQL for data storage, making it easy to:

- Submit sightings with photos and GPS coordinates
- Visualize all reports on an interactive map
- Filter sightings by date, location, and observer
- Generate data exports for scientific analysis
- Access statistics and FAQs about the European Mantis
