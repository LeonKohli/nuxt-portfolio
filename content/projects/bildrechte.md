# Bildrechte: Understanding Image Rights

I kept seeing students and small business owners unknowingly violating image copyright laws online, so I built a site that explains how image rights actually work in plain language.

![Bildrechte](images/projects/demo/quiz.png)

## What It Covers

- Basic copyright principles for images
- License types (Creative Commons, commercial, etc.)
- How to attribute images correctly
- Common misconceptions about "free" images
- German-specific image laws

## How It Works

Built with Nuxt.js and TailwindCSS. There's an interactive quiz so people can test what they actually know (spoiler: usually less than they think). Several schools in Germany have started using it as a reference.
