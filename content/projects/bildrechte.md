# Bildrechte: Understanding Image Rights

After noticing how many people (especially students and small business owners) were unknowingly violating image copyright laws online, I created this educational resource to help demystify the complex world of image rights.

## Educational Content

The site covers several key areas:

- Basic copyright principles for images
- Different types of licenses (Creative Commons, commercial, etc.)
- How to properly attribute images
- Common misconceptions about "free" images
- German-specific laws regarding image usage

## Technical Implementation

Built with Nuxt.js and TailwindCSS, the site features an interactive quiz that helps users test their knowledge of image rights. The content is presented in a clear, accessible way with practical examples that make abstract legal concepts more understandable.

The project has been shared with several educational institutions in Germany and serves as a quick reference guide for content creators who want to ensure they're respecting copyright laws.
