# Interactive Particle Network


## How It Works

The animation uses vanilla JavaScript to create a canvas-based particle system where:

- Hundreds of particles move slowly across the screen
- Particles connect with lines when they come within proximity
- Mouse movement influences particle behavior
- The system automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- Performance is optimized even with many particles

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to any viewport size
- **Dynamic Generation**: Creates a unique starfield each time
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust particle density, speed, colors, and connection behavior
- **No Dependencies**: Built with pure JavaScript, no external libraries required
- **Predefined Configurations**: Choose from themes like "Starry Night," "Astral Serenity," and more

## Predefined Themes

The project includes several ready-to-use configurations:
- **Starry Night**: Classic dark blue background with white stars
- **Astral Serenity**: Soft blue particles with gentle movement
- **Nebula Burst**: Colorful particles with explosive movement patterns
- **Cosmic Web**: Interconnected particles forming web-like structures
- **Galactic Symphony**: Coordinated particle movements resembling celestial bodies
- **Celestial Dream**: Dreamy, slow-moving particles with subtle connections
- **Quantum Realm**: Microscopic-looking particle system with rapid movements
- **Eternal Twilight**: Dusk-colored background with contrasting particles
- **Alien Encounter**: Unusual color schemes and movement patterns
- **Cybernetic Circuit**: Digital-looking connections resembling circuit boards
