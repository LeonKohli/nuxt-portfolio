# Interactive Particle Network

Canvas-based starfield animation I built as a drop-in background for web projects. No dependencies, just vanilla JS.

## How It Works

Vanilla JavaScript canvas animation. Hundreds of particles drift across the screen, connecting with lines when they get close to each other. Your mouse influences their movement. Adjusts to screen size automatically and stays smooth even with lots of particles.

## Key Features

- Adapts to any viewport size
- Generates a unique starfield each time
- Adjustable particle density, speed, colors, and connection behavior
- Pure JavaScript, no external libraries
- Several predefined themes (Starry Night, Astral Serenity, and more)

## Predefined Themes

Ships with 10 ready-to-use configs: Starry Night, Astral Serenity, Nebula Burst, Cosmic Web, Galactic Symphony, Celestial Dream, Quantum Realm, Eternal Twilight, Alien Encounter, and Cybernetic Circuit. Or tweak the parameters and make your own.
